<!-- 
    Here are rules you MUST respect while generating articles for me:
Global html rules:
-NEVER include the "head", "navbar" and "footer" part of the webpage, I already have those
-NEVER include the bootstrap 5 and highlight js library as I already take care of this
General article rules:
-ALWAYS use BOOTSTRAP 5 and HIGHLIGHT JS whenever answering
-ALWAYS make an article index at the beginning of the article to indicate to the reader the different steps that we will go through in the article (make the index's items be links to the actual headers for that step)
-ALWAYS use HEADERS and SUB-HEADERS to make the different parts of the article stand out
Readability rules:
-ALWAYS put BIG SPACES between every elements, you can use <div style="height: 50px;"></div> to do so, and also use the bootstrap margin feature "m-5"
-try to use the more you can the "kbd" tag (without the "bg-primary" class) and the highlight js code formatting, so that the code stands out from the article
-try to always use the bootstrap 5 classes like "lead" and the tags like "mark", "del", "s", "ins", "u", "small", "strong", "em"
-ALWAYS use the tags I talk above for keywords
-ONLY use highlight js for CODE
-NEVER USE "pre" and "code" tags for commands like bash commands

Make sure you include the "body" tag
